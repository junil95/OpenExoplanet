CSCC01 Deliverable 2 Marking Guide
-----------------------------------

T23 SegFault
TOTAL: 81

Personas:  15 / 20

  Format: 4 / 4

      must contain: gender, age, personality, skills, environment,
      attitude towards technology in general, attitude towards
      computer software, goals when using the system

      Too many irrelevant details are not useful!

  Information content:  4 / 8

      The purpose of each persona is clear. Personas suggest different
      system requirements.

      * Missing goals for using your system.
      * Missing ability with version control software.

  Coverage: 7 / 8
    * See comment beside Alison Singer's persona.

      personas must include at least two of the following type of users:

      -- "Hanno type"

      -- Hanno's grad student: can approve modifications to the data,
           but cannot add other such users (only Hanno can)

      -- A less tech-savvy astronomer: Sure, Hanno is the client who
           makes the order, but the software will be released as
           open-source, so other types of users are 100% realistic.


Product Backlog:  36 / 50

    2 / 10 : User stories follow the format
                "As __name__ (__role__), I want __something__."
		("so that __benefit__" is optional)
	       AND each __name__ corresponds to one of the personas.

    6 / 10 : User stories, together, reflect all the user
    	        requirements (from all prospective users).

    10 / 10 : User stories correspond to actual requirements (no
    	        "invented" features).

                estimate how long it would take to implement it.

    9 / 10 : Each user story addresses one specific requirement (no
                "world peace" stories).
