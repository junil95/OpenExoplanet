							I love to spend time tackling side projects both
							indivudally and with the help or other talented individuals. In particular
							I have an affinity for mobile devlopment be it a game or an app.

						<h1> A Summary </h1>
						<p> As a technology enthusiast and Computer Science student at the University of Toronto, I have a passion for
							developing and working with innovative software. I particularly enjoy designing and creating useful programs,
							applications and tools  to facilitate difficult tasks in people's lives. I am also a problem solver. Through persistance and hardwork,
							I have become adept at overcoming challenging and interesting problems in unique and creative ways. While working on projects
							such as replicating the Unix shell, making a Java game, building a Firefighting robot and creating an Android utility app, I
							have strengthened my knowledge of fundamental software design and programming concepts and gained experience in utilizing
							3rd party software tools and frameworks to facilitate development. With my enthusiasm to learn, grow and succeed, I look forward to working on
							interesting and innovative projects where I can demonstrate and develop my technical, teamwork and leadership skills.

						<p> I am a third year student at the University of Toronto Scarborough, specializing in Information Systems.
							My love for computers started at a very young age, but it wasn't until I participated in
							various technical extracurricular activities such as Robotics, that I decided to make computer science my career.
						</p>
						<p> During my educational career, I learned to implement various projects such as Android applications, in multiple programming
							languages such as Python, Java, and C. I also gained proficiency in MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript through various database
							projects. Along with this, I had the opportunity to utilize what I learned through internships at TD Bank and CIBC. This
							corporate world experience helped me decide that I want to further grow in the field of project management. In the future,
							I plan on working for a couple of years
							after graduation and then going back to school to complete my Masters in Business Administration (MBA),
							so that I can further grow in my career

						<h1> A Summary </h1>
						<p> I'm a 20-year-old Computer Science Specialist currently in my third year, working towards my bachelor's degree at UTSC. Growing up in Brampton,
							I enjoyed problem solving and math throughout middle school and really gained interest in computer science after taking a few programming
							courses in high school. I'm a self-motivated individual and a lot of what I learned in high school was self-taught. I gained proficiency
							in various different programming languages through school projects as well as working on side projects outside of school. I'm skilled in
							Java, C, Python, shell scripting and visual basic; I also gained som experience in C++ while working with the Oculus SDK for a side project.
							The highlight of my professional life was being invited to DX3 as a cofounder of a startup project. With my passion to learn and improve,
							 I look forward to hone and apply my skills on future projects.

						<h1> A Summary </h1>
						<p> I am a third-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree through the

							Ever since my first computer science course in high school, I’ve had a fond interest in the
							industry. During my free time, I like to work on personal projects and try to learn concepts
							which are not covered during the school year. Through my coursework as a Computer Science candidate at
							 the University of Toronto Scarborough, I developed my problem solving and analytical skills extensively
							  using various programming languages including Java, C, Python and Unix shell scripting.  With
								numerous work and volunteer experiences under my belt, I’m able to bring forth excellent work
