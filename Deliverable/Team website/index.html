					<p> Welcome! I am John Song, a student currently studying computer science, at the University of Toronto (UTSG's sister campus UTSC in particular) who can't live without structure, design, and sarcasm. I love to spend time tackling side projects both
						indivudally and with the help or other talented individuals. In particular I have an affinity for mobile devlopment be it a game or an app.
					</p>
					<p> I hope one day I can impress the "kind people" of the Internet with something great and innovative, until then tune in to the new episode of "The Adventure of a New Developer!".

					<h1> A Summary </h1>
					<p> As a technology enthusiast and Computer Science student at the University of Toronto, I have a passion for developing and working with innovative software. I particularly enjoy designing and creating useful programs, applications and tools to facilitate
						difficult tasks in people's lives. I am also a problem solver. Through persistance and hardwork, I have become adept at overcoming challenging and interesting problems in unique and creative ways. While working on projects such as replicating the
						Unix shell, making a Java game, building a Firefighting robot and creating an Android utility app, I have strengthened my knowledge of fundamental software design and programming concepts and gained experience in utilizing 3rd party software tools
						and frameworks to facilitate development. With my enthusiasm to learn, grow and succeed, I look forward to working on interesting and innovative projects where I can demonstrate and develop my technical, teamwork and leadership skills.

					<h1> A Summary </h1>
					<p> I am a third year student at the University of Toronto Scarborough, specializing in Information Systems. My love for computers started at a very young age, but it wasn't until I participated in various technical extracurricular activities such as
						Robotics, that I decided to make computer science my career.
					</p>
					<p> During my educational career, I learned to implement various projects such as Android applications, in multiple programming languages such as Python, Java, and C. I also gained proficiency in MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript through various database
						projects. Along with this, I had the opportunity to utilize what I learned through internships at TD Bank and CIBC. This corporate world experience helped me decide that I want to further grow in the field of project management. In the future, I
						plan on working for a couple of years after graduation and then going back to school to complete my Masters in Business Administration (MBA), so that I can further grow in my career

					<h1> A Summary </h1>
					<p> I'm a 20-year-old Computer Science Specialist currently in my third year, working towards my bachelor's degree at UTSC. Growing up in Brampton, I enjoyed problem solving and math throughout middle school and really gained interest in computer science
						after taking a few programming courses in high school. I'm a self-motivated individual and a lot of what I learned in high school was self-taught. I gained proficiency in various different programming languages through school projects as well as
						working on side projects outside of school. I'm skilled in Java, C, Python, shell scripting and visual basic; I also gained som experience in C++ while working with the Oculus SDK for a side project. The highlight of my professional life was being
						invited to DX3 as a cofounder of a startup project. With my passion to learn and improve, I look forward to hone and apply my skills on future projects.

					<h1> A Summary </h1>
					<p> I am a third-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree through the coop specialist Software Engineering stream in the Computer Science and Mathematics program. Ever since my first computer science course in high school, I’ve
						had a fond interest in the industry. During my free time, I like to work on personal projects and try to learn concepts which are not covered during the school year. Through my coursework as a Computer Science candidate at the University of Toronto
						Scarborough, I developed my problem solving and analytical skills extensively using various programming languages including Java, C, Python and Unix shell scripting. With numerous work and volunteer experiences under my belt, I’m able to bring forth
						excellent work ethic, communication and interpersonal skills to uplift and contribute towards the betterment of the team.

									By the end of deliverable 2, we had completed personas for the potential users of the system and the user stories for the product. At the start of deliverable 3, we started planning how to implement some of the user stories and decided their priorities and costs. We the picked out the highest priority user stories and broke them down further into different tasks. After distributing the tasks amongst ourselves we started tackling the problem. Dhrumil finished creating local copies of the three databases and also finished a majority of the update detection between different versions of the eu and nasa catalogues. John finished the task of detecting new planets during the initial merge. Rishi is working on converting csv data to xml. Junil worked on determining where to place new planets or stars. Dhrumil and Tirth worked on extracting important data from the csv catalogues as well.

									We didn't follow the plan exactly. All of us had several midterms so we couldn't contribute enough hours everyday.  Also it took us longer to extract important data from the csv catalogues because it was hard to determine what columns were required by the client. We also had to replan the csv to xml conversion, our initial design required hard coding a lot of strings so we decided to improve it.
