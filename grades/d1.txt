    clarity: 1/1
    makes good use of each member's background: 0.5/2
      - Lacking details. A paragraph is better.


2) Introduce the team members:        28 out of 30

   I am assuming 5 members. If your team has four members,
   scale accordingly.

   for each member:
      approx 150 words: 0/1, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1
      spelling and grammar: 1/1, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1
      clarity: 1/1, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1, 1/1
      professionalism: 2/2, 2/2, 2/2, 2/2, 2/2

   The members' introductions are consistent w.r.t. person (in
   first/third person), style, qualities/interests described, etc., so
   that the overall introduction reads well:      4/5
    - One biography is not like the others. Hmm...


3) Team agreement:      9 out of 10

    methods of communication, including wait time for replies, clearly stated:  2/2
    meeting times arranged:  2/2
    contingency planning (member is sick, missing meetings, not performing up to standards, etc.):  2/2
    use of version control is discussed:  2/2
    some planning of individual roles:  1/2
      - Why can't we decide on expertise now?

TOTAL: 45.5/50
