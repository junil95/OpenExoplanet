Our submission is a html page with our deliverables and info under it. All available information is available in a tab below our group pictures and can be navigated with the selected tab-panes. 


We created a front end for our system and placed it on a server. It is located at https://pacific-shelf-92985.herokuapp.com/#fakelink. Press update to start the merge process. Please note that the initial update may take around 1 minute because it needs to download the other catalogues. Be patient.

How to setup the application on the Heroku Server?

1. Make an account on Heroku
2. Clone the uploaded copy branch by using the command git clone -b my-branch git@github.com:user/myproject.git.
3. Open the terminal and cd to the cloned directory and enter the command heroku create. This should create an app on heroku with a random name. 
4. Now the branch that we cloned from git needs to be pushed to heroku, use the command, git push heroku uploaded-copy:master. This will place the git branch onto heroku and deploy the application. 
5. Now go to your heroku account, go to the created app and then settings to find the url where the application will be hosted. Go to the specified url to find deployed heroku app.
